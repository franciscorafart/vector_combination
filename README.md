# Array combination challenge.

Problem:
You're given a vector of vectors of words, e.g.:
[['quick', 'lazy'], ['brown', 'black', 'grey'], ['fox', 'dog']].

Write a generalized function that prints all combinations of one word from the first vector, one word from the second vector, etc.
The solution may not use recursion.

NOTE: the number of vectors and number of elements within each vector may vary.
